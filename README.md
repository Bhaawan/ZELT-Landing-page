# ZELT-Landing-page

I have developed a clone of the Zelt landing page using HTML, CSS, JS, GSAP, locomotive.js, and canvas. 👨‍💻💻 I have integrated the majority of the existing animations and added some additional animations as well. 🎨🎉 Furthermore, I have made some modifications to the design, including changes to the font. 🌟 The landing page is also responsive to cater to devices of varying sizes. 📱👍
